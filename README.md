# Tavernlight-Submission
 
This is my submission for the Tavernlight Games software developer job position. 

The project files included in this submission were taken from the following repos:

Client: https://github.com/edubart/otclient

# Folder Categories

All the files used to produce the project are in the PROJECT FILES directory. The individual files for each questions are in their respective folders(Q1-Q7). For Q5 and Q7, those directories will have an additional README that will describe the location where each file would be in the full project.
